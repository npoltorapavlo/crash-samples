> To avoid static initialization problem, can use the Construct On First Use Idiom. Using a pointer will leak the object. Using object doesnâ€™t leak the object, but it does not control the order of static deinitialization. To guarantee both static initialization and static deinitialization, use the Nifty Counter Idiom.
